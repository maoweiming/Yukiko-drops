:sweat_drops: <br> <br> 

This tool was created in Unity3D to allow for the fast prototyping of visual ideas. <br>
This experiement came to my mind as I got hired to work on an advertisement project - as a game developer, using Unity to create an "art tool" based on the brief requirements for the designers to play with seemed like fun to try out. <br> <br>
Feel free to use it and edit it as you feel it!
